# Optuna hyperparameter search

This repository was created based on the YouTube tutorial [Hyperparameter Tuning Machine Learning Models with OPTUNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgdEZ6LFj-I) from Karndeep Singh.
The purpose of the repository is to replicate how hyperparameter optimization of a model is done with Optuna through hyperparameter search.
The video's use case is the optimization of a Bayesian model with the iris dataset.

## What is Optuna
[Optuna: A hyperparameter optimization framework](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning. 
It features an imperative, define-by-run style user API. 
Thanks to our define-by-run API, the code written with Optuna enjoys high modularity, and the user of Optuna can dynamically construct the search spaces for the hyperparameters.(Optuna Documentation)
